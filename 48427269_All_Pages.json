It is working fine, but I'm not sure if what I do is efficient. </p>\n\n<p>What I'm doing at the moment is evaluating an iterator's <code>get_next()</code> method, which gives me a bunch of elements like the actual image, its label, filename, etc. I then feed the image into my model using the <code>feed_dict</code>. </p>\n\n<p>I know that <code>feed_dict</code> is very slow, so am I losing benefits of <code>Dataset</code> and Iterators and having serialised dataset in <code>TFRecord</code>s by evaluating the entries and feeding them into the graph via <code>feed_dict</code>? I haven't found any examples in TF's documentation which shows how one's expected to use Iterator's <code>get_next()</code> to feed elements into the model. Is it better to unpack <code>get_next()</code> and use the result directly in my graph? </p>\n"}], "has_more": false, "quota_max": 300, "quota_remaining": 110}]

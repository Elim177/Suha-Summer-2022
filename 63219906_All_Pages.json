Since it has been removed, I have to use a different solution to create my simplified learning rate optimisation, where I compare the previous cost to the new cost, if the previous is bigger, increase the learning rate, otherwise decrease it. Cost is always a scalar tensor, I stack the previous one with the new cost, get the index of the bigger one with <code>.argMax()</code>, and get the item from my &quot;constant&quot; tensor which just stores two values, how much to multiply the learning rate with, by the index -the result of <code>.argMax()</code>.</p>\n<p>An example would be:</p>\n<pre><code>let learningRate = tf.tensor(1);\n\nconst prevCost = tf.tensor(1);\nconst nextCost = tf.tensor(2);\n\nconst modifiers = tf.tensor([1.05, 0.5]);\n\nconst bigger = tf.stack([prevCost, nextCost]).argMax(); // 1\n\nconst modifier = modifiers.get(// if it would still exist\n  bigger\n); // 0.5\n\nlearningRate = learningRate.mul(modifier); // 1 * 0.5 = 0.5\n</code></pre>\n<p>But unfortunately <code>.get()</code> doesn't exist anymore, however, there should be a method to do that.</p>\n"}], "has_more": false, "quota_max": 300, "quota_remaining": 289}]

I normally use the functions directly (e.g, tf.layers.dense) but I'd like to know how to use classes directly (tf.layers.<strong>D</strong>ense). I've started experimenting with the new eager execution mode in tensorflow and I think using classes are going to be useful there as well but I haven't seen good examples in the documentation. Is there any part of TF documentation that shows how these are used? </p>\n\n<p>I guess it would make sense to use them in a class where these layers are instantiated in the <code>__init__</code> and then they're linked in the <code>__call__</code> method when the inputs and dimensions are known?</p>\n\n<p>Are these tf.layer classes related to <code>tf.keras.Model</code>? Is there an equivalent wrapper class for using <code>tf.layers</code>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> for eager execution there's <code>tfe.Network</code> that must be inherited. There's an example <a href=\"https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/neural_network_eager_api.py\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n"}], "has_more": false, "quota_max": 300, "quota_remaining": 81}]

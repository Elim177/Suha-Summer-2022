The training goal is to minimize the batch log loss. When I test the model, batches are used as well. For accuracy and AUC, I can use <code>tf.metrics.auc</code> and <code>tf.matrics.accuracy</code> to get running accuracy and AUC. However, how can I get running logloss for the test data?</p>\n"}], "has_more": false, "quota_max": 300, "quota_remaining": 82}]

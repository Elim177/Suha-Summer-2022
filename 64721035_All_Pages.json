I know that I can load the model, but how can I say I was at the 5 epoch and now you only have to go through 5 epochs because I wanted a total of 10.</p>\n<pre><code>cp_callback = [tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(\n    filepath='/saved/model.h5', \n    verbose=1, \n    save_weights_only=True,\n    save_freq= 'epoch'),\n    tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='loss', patience=2)]\n</code></pre>\n"}], "has_more": false, "quota_max": 300, "quota_remaining": 150}]

I'm experiencing a memory leak which I described earlier in my <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68349724/memory-leak-that-persists-after-colab-cell-executes\">post</a>. I've been trying to find a way to profile memory of the things going on inside a <code>tf.function</code> ever since. But as it has always been the case, the documentation is as useless as never existing. For those who ever experienced memory leaks while using <code>tf.function</code>, is there a way to actually see what memory is allocated to which objects? Forget about tracemalloc, objgraph, memory-profiler which won't work, and of course the official tensorflow profiler which doesn't have a documentation.  Let's say the leak won't happen unless there is a <code>tf.function</code> somewhere, what are the options here?</p>\n"}], "has_more": false, "quota_max": 300, "quota_remaining": 201}]
